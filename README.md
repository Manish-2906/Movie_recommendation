Project 2: Movie Recommendation System Overview: This project is a Movie Recommendation System designed to help users discover movies tailored to their preferences. It provides a seamless, user-friendly interface to suggest similar movies based on a selected title. Using a precomputed similarity matrix and real-time data fetched from the TMDB API, the system displays movie recommendations with high-resolution posters. The project addresses the challenge of personalized movie recommendations, making it easier for users to explore new content aligned with their interests.

Tools and Technologies Programming Language: Python Libraries:

-Streamlit: For building the web-based application.

-Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

-NumPy: For numerical computations.

-Requests: For API integration to fetch real-time data.

-Pickle: For storing and loading preprocessed datasets.

-APIs: TMDB API: For retrieving movie posters and details dynamically.

Other Tools:

-Jupyter Notebook: For data preprocessing and similarity matrix computation.

-Streamlit Cloud: For deployment.

Data Visualization While the main focus of the project is recommendation generation, visual representation plays a significant role in enhancing user engagement. User Interface Highlights: Poster Display: Each recommended movie is presented with its high-resolution poster, offering users a visually immersive experience. Interactive Grid: Movies are displayed in a five-column layout. Each column features the movie title and poster, making recommendations visually appealing and easy to browse.![Screenshot (159)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23bf99e1-7123-4158-a924-bb5981814d43)
